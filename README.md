# FIX DISCORD PINGS
FIX DISCORD PINGS is a chrome extension that changes the colour of discord pings from the disgusting shade of yellow/orange to a much nicer greyish blue, fitting in with the dark theme and being more gentle on the eyes. The colour of the pings can be configured in style.css, I might make it configurable inside the extension in the future.
